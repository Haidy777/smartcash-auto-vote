# [WIP]SmartCash-Auto-Vote

As [StmartCash](https://smartcash.cc/) recently
[announced](https://smartcash.cc/announcing-improved-smartrewards-and-smartcash-supernodes/)
there are plans to bind [SmartRewards](https://smartrewards.cc/) to SmartVoting
and I don't have the time to Vote myself. I figured I could build a small script doing this for me.

Currently there are several steps involved to get this running which I will add soon as I've time.

I'm not exactly sure if this violates the terms of SmartCash, use at your own RISK!

Contributions are always welcome.
